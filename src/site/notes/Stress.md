# Stress
## Stress as a stimulus 
- Stress as a stimulus treats stress as a lofe event or change that demands response adjustment or adaptation. In this way stress acts as an independant variable 
## Stress as a response 
- Stress as a response treats stress as a physiological dependant variable - a response to outside factors 

# Selye’s Stress definition 
- Stress as a response model, 
	- ‘stress is not what happens to you, but how you react to it’
- Selye defined stress as a ‘nonspecific response of the body o any demand’ demands can be physiological or psychological 

- He also explained how stress and health were biochemically linked, and that chronic stress created physiological illness when the endocrine system became exhausted in his general adaptation syndrome theory 

# Models of Stress 
## Stress as a response - general adaption syndrome 
### Alarm
- Initial symptoms of the body under tress; “fight or flight” response, heart rate increased, adremal gland releases cortisol, adrenaile booost, increased energy 
### Resistance 
- body begins to repair itself and return to homeostasis; releases lower amount of cortisol, heart rate and blood pressure begin to normalize. You either overcome stress and your body continues to repair itself until you reach a pre-stress state, or you don’t resolve the stress and your body remains on high alert. If the resistance stage continues for too long without pauses to offset the effects of stress, this can lead to the exhaustion stage.

Signs of the resistance stage include: irritability, frustration, poor concentration.
### Exhaustion 
- result of prolonged or chronic stress. Struggling with stress for long periods can drain your physical, emotional, and mental resources to the point where your body no longer has strength to fight stress. 

Signs of exhaustion include: fatigue, burnout, depression, anxiety, decreased stress tolerance.

The physical effects of this stage also weaken your immune system and put you at risk for stress-related illnesses.



# Transactional theory of stress
- Three key steps 

1. Primary appraisal 
	1. The impact the stressor will have on your wellbeing 
2. Secondary appraisal 
	1. The resources that you have t your disposal that will help you to cope with the stressor, these may be internal and external. (willpower, confidence vs financial backing, raw materials)
3. Using coping strategies
	1. This might include problem bases strategies (informatiojn hgathering, delegation, or confrontation, or emotion based strategies (taking ownership or seeking moral support and emotion support))

## Interaction between individual and environment 
- The emphasis is on the relationship between the person, including their unique traits, and the characteristics of the environment event taken place. 

### Emotion vs problem focused 
- Emotion focuses on treating the symptoms but problem focuses on fixing the stressor
