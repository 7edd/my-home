# Recall 
- Recall uses questions which ask you to retrieve info from memory without any prompts or cues
	- Example: who won the women's 400 m race at the Sydney Olypics?
It should be noted that there are three different kinds of recall tasks
## Free recall 
- A free recall task would have you remember items in a list in any order 
## Serial Recall 
- A serial recall task requires participants to recall a list of items in a specific order, usially the order in which they were presented 
## Cued Recall 
- Cued recall refers to retrieving information from long-term memory using aids or cues. Cues can be external stimuli, such as words, sentences, incomplete pictures, letters within a word, and so on, as long as they have some kind of connection 

# Recognition 
- Questions which ask you to identify from a number of alternatives

### Recall vs Recognition 
- Regardless of the type of information to be remembered, people find recognition easier than recall
