## Syllabus 
- Attribution theory to explain behaviour 
- Situational and dispositional attributions 

## What is it 
- Attribution theory assumes that people try to determine why people do what they do 
- Attribution theory is concerned with how individuals interpret events and how this relates to their thinking and behaviour 
- A person seeking to understand why another person did something may attribute one or more causes to that behaviour 

### Internal attribution 
- Person is behaving in a certain way because of something about the person, such as attitude, character or personality 

### External attribution 
- A person is behaving a certain way because of something about the situation he or she is in 
## Self serving bias
- We not only make attributions about others, we make them about our own behaviour. 
- The tendancy to take personal credit for success and blame situational causes for failure
