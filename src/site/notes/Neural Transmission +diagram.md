# 1

An electrical impulse (action potential) travels along the axon which reaches the axon terminal

# 2

The impulse stimulates the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters

# 3

These chemicals are stored in vesicles in the axon terminal

# 4

Neurotransmitters are released from the vesicles and travel along the synapse

# 5

Neurotransmitters are received by receptor sites on the dendrites of the next neuron

# 6

The dendrites interprets the message and turns into an electrical signal to be sent along the neuron

# 7

Neurotransmitters are ejected from receptor back into synapse where they are broken down by enzymes or released into the vesicles on pre synaptic neuron
