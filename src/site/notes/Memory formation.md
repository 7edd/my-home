# Hippocampus 
The hippocampus is a curved shaped structure deep within each temporal love. 

Core of the brains limbic system, a group of structures involved in processing and regulating emotions and memories 

Strongly associated with the formation of memories , is an early storage place for new long term memories and involved in transition of these long term memories to more permanent memories

## Central role 
- Instrumental in forming long-term declarative memories. It acts as a hub, consolidating various elements of experiences into cohesive memory representations.
## Interactions with other brain regions 
- Works in concert with other brain areas. This collaboration is essential for transitioning memories from short-term to long-term storage, a process known as declarative memory consolidation.
## Binding of Experience Elements
- Binds disparate sensory and contextual details into a unified memory. This distributed storage mechanism allows for the interconnected nature of declarative memories, where recalling one aspect can trigger the entire memory.
## Contribution to Autobiographical and Emotional Memory
- The hippocampus is key in forming autobiographical memories, which are personal experiences that define an individual's life story. It is involved in emotional memory as well (in association with the amygdala).
## **MEMORY FORMATION

- Important in the **organisation** and **storage** of new memories, especially declarative memories.
- Responsible for making memories stronger by connecting sensations and emotions them. The hippocampus has links with the amygdala, a structure associated with emotions, especially fear.
- Case study of Henry Molaison 1953 where portion medial temporal lobes (including hippocampus) was removed resulting in inability to form new memories.
    

## **STORAGE OF MEMORIES**

- Memories are temporarily held in hippocampus before being moved to the pre-frontal cortex. 
- It can take in memory information, register it, then temporarily store it before it is then transferred to long-term memory stores.
- Sleep is thought to play a critical role in the process of this.
- Information circulates whilst neurons start to encode this information through a process called long-term potentiation.
- **Long-term potentiation:** a form of neural plasticity and vital mechanism in the storage of memory.
- When this occurs, the strongest of the circulating information then returns to the brain area where it originated from in order to turn the short-term memories into long-term memories.
