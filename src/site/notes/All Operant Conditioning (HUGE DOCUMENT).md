## Token economies
the application of operant conditioning using symbolic reinforcers to encourage a behaviour. 

token economies are a **behaviour modification technique** that only uses positive reinforcement to increase the occurrence of a desired behaviour 

it uses secondary reinforcers (the symbolic token given after each desired behaviour) and primary reinforcers (tangible ‘larger’ reward after a decided number of repeated behaviours). 

often used by parents and teachers, a common example is a ‘star chart’, where children gain symbolic tokens (stars on a chart) which they then exchange for a desired reward after an agreed upon number (ed. 10 stars and they can choose a new toy). 

Tokens are generally NOT removed as punishment 
## Social learning theory 
bandura’s social learning theory proposed that learning can also occur simply by observing the actions of others. 

- social learning theory: people learn though observing, imitating, and modelling others behaviour, specifically learning often occurs because people observe the consequences of other peoples behaviour 
- behaviour is assumed to be developed and regulated by: 

- external stimulus events such as the influence of other individuals 
- eternal reinforcement, such as braise, blame and reward 
- eg if a student receives extra credit for arriving early too class and another student in the classroom observes this, the latter student may model the behaviour by arriving a few minutes really each day as well . 

- people observe behaviour either 

- directly through social interactions 
- indirectly through the media 

- actions that are rewarded are more likely to be imitated 
- actions that are punished are more likely to be avoided 
#### people can learn through observations 

- demonstrated in his BOBO doll experiments 
- bandura’ identified three basic models of observational learning: 

- live model: involves an actual individual demonstrating or acting out a behaviour 
- symbolic model: involves a real or fictional characters displaying gbehaviours in books, films, television programs, or online media. 
- verbal instruction model: involves descriptions and explanations of a behaviour 
#### mental states are important to learning 

- bandora noted external, environmental reinforcement was not the only factor to influence learning and behaviour. and that reinforcement does not always come from outside sources 
- mental state and motivation play an important role in determining wether a behaviour is learned or not. 
- he described intrinsic reinforcement as a form of internal regards, such as pride, satisfaction, and sense of accomplishment 
- this emphasis on internal thoughts and cognition helps connect learning theories to cognitive developmental theories 
#### learning does not necessarily lead to behaviour change 

- in many cases learning can be seen immediately when the new behaviour is displayed (eg when you teach a child to ride a bicycle, you can see if learning has occurred by having the child ride their bike unassisted) but sometimes we are able to learn things even though that learning might not be immediately obvious 
- unlike behaviourists who believed learning led to a. permanent change in behaviour, observational learning demonstrates that people can learn new information without demonstrating new behaviours 
## Real world application 

- can be used to help researchers understand how aggression and violence might be transmitted through observational learning. by studying media violence, researches can gain a better understanding of the factors that might lead children to act out the aggressive actions they see portrayed on television and in the movies. 
- can also be utilised to teach people positive behaviours. researchers can use social learning theory to investigate and understand ways that positive role models can be used to encourage desirable behaviours to facilitate social change. 
## Evaluation 

### strengths 

- investigated using experiments, therefore it is scientific 
- emphasises the importance of our environment and, in particular, role models 
- explains how we learn many behaviours, such as aggression ,
- highlights learners active role 

### Weaknesses 

- experiments crease a false setting and the results may not reflect real life behaviour. ignores the role of nature and biological factors. 
- too simplistic, there are other explanations for something like aggression 

- eg hormones 
## Observational learning 

- observational learning takes place when a new behaviour is learned or modifies as a result of watching other and copying their behaviours, or after watching the consequences of the behaviour of others. 
### Elements of observational learning 

- for observational learning to occur, several factors or mediation processes must be involved. these include 

- attentions 
- retention 
- reproduction
- motivation
- reinforcement 
#### Attention 

- the learner must pay attention to the model 
- if the learner does not pay attention or recognise the important features of the models behaviour, then they will not learn though observation. 
- simply exposing an individual to a model will not mean that they will attend to them closely 
- it has been found that models with interesting qualities are more likely to succeed in grabbing the learners attention and models who lack pleasing characteristics tend to be ignored. 
#### Retention 

learner mrs remember what was done by the model so that the information can be encoded and stored in their memos system for later use 

learner does this by making a mental representation of the models behaviour using two representational system s 

- one using images 
- one using verbal representations 
#### Reproduction 

- learner must be able to reproduce the modelled behaviour, so they must have the psychological, intellectual and physical capacity to be able to demonstrate the modelled behaviours 

- eg. unable to replicate high jumping 
#### motivation and reinforcement 

- the learner must have the desire, or motivation, to repeat the observed behaviour 
- the learner must also perceive some form of reward for the repeating the observed behaviour. normal reinforcement determines if it will be repeated later. 
- while experiencing these motivators can be highly effective , so can observing others experiencing some type of reinforcement or punishment. for example, if you see another student rewarded with extra credit for being to class on time, you might start to show up on time 
#### vicarious reinforcement 

- if an observer sees a model having a behaviour reinforced, the observer is likely to modify their own behaviour. if this has happened, the observer has experienced vicarious reinforcement. 
- as you may have guessed, an observer is less likely to imitate behaviours that they have seen another being punished for. 
- in both cases, the observer/learner does not need to experience either the reinforcement or punishment to adopt the behaviour or not.

# The bobo doll experiment 

  

## Aim 

- to determine wether children who observe an adult behaving aggressively will imitate the aggressive behaviour 

## method 

### participants 

- 36 boys and 36 girls aged between three and four years old were selected via convenience sampling from the childcare centre at Stanford university

### Design 

- the independent variable was the exposure of children to aggressive adult models versus non aggressive adult models. the dependent variable was the observed aggressive behaviour in the children recorded every five seconds for 20 minutes. 

## Procedure 

- after the children’s parents have consent for their participations 
- randomly allocated into three groups, the aggressive model condition, non-aggressive model condition and control group 
- children in the control group did not partake in the first stage of the experiment this were not exposed to an adult model. 
- children from the experimental groups were individually brought into the experimental room, seated at a table and shown a craft activity they could complete

- an adult model was taken to the opposite corner of the room with toys, including a bobo doll and mallet with pegboard for them to play with. 
- in each of the two experimental groups, half of the children observed a model of the opposite sex and half watched a same-sex model. 

- children in the aggressive model condition were exposed to the adult model behaving aggressively towards the bobo doll. thsndadising actions were performed by the adult: sitting on the bobo doll and punching its nose, hitting it on the head with the mallet, throwing it in the air and kicking it around the room  
- the adult model in the non aggressive condition played with the other toys instead of the bobo doll. 
### stage 2 

- after 10 minutes of exposure the experiment took the child to a second room with desirable toys, but
- soon after the child starts playing, an adult told them the toys were reserved for other children and that there are toys the can play with in the adjoining room. frustrating the children instigated aggressive arousal in the children. 
### stage 3 

the room was set up the same for each child and the children, including those in the control group, participated in this stage 

the experimenter worked quietly in the corner of the room 

each child was observed for 20 minutes by the researcher watching through a one way mirror and their behaviour was soared against a set of predetermined criteria 
## key findings 

children will imitate behaviours, even without any reinforcement or punishment 
## Contributions 

- bobo doll study provided a framework from which research grew into the effect violence shown on television had on aggressive behaviours in children. 
- previous studies demonstrated children imitated behaviour displayed by adult models when in the presence of adult models. this study was unique as it showed that observational learning occurs in situations differing from that in which the model was initially obsereed, and even in settings that do not feature the observed model. 
## criticisms and limitations 

- children in the aggressive model condition may have experienced a degree of psychological distress if they had not been exposed to aggressive behaviour previously. 
- the study was performed in a laboratory setting and was not typical of a real world. situation, thus it is argued that it has low validity 
- mallet in the room amy indicate to the child that they are expected to do 
- limited sample size and participant characteristic could affect generalisability 
- only looked at short term effects of social learning, not long term and short term effects may not generalise to long term behaviour
