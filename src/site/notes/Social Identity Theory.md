# Syllabus

- Social identity theory - Tajfel and Turner (1979)
	- Social categorisation, social identification, social comparison 

# Tajfel

- In the late 1970s, Henri Tajfel and his team conducted a series of studies that would lead to the creation of the Social Identity Theory. The theory looks at why we are so loyal to groups that we belong to and why identification with one group inevitably causes conflict with others.

# In-groups and Out-groups

- For every group or in-group that you belong to, there is another group. These people that don't identify in the same way. The others. The students who go to other colleges who come from different families or practice different religions. 

- Social identity theory only attempts to explain this "us vs them" mentality, but also the symptoms of that mentality: prejudice, stereotyping

- Tajfel proposed that the groups which people belonged to were and important source of pride and self esteem
- Groups give us a sense of social identity: a sense of belonging to the social world
- The central hypothesis of social identity theory is that group members of an in-group will seek to find negative aspects of an out-group to enhance their self image. 

# Social Comparison

- The final stage is social comparison. Once we have categorised ourselves as a part of a group and have identified with that group we then tend to compare that group with other groups. If our self-esteem is to be maintained out group needs to compare favourably with other groups 

## Social Categorisation
- The process of identifying a person as a member of a certain group because of features they share. 
- When you think of people as belonging to a group rather than as an individual - putting them in social caetgories.
- This is often a necessary to to make sense of out world and function effectively.
