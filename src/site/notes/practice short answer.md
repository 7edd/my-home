Analyse how the codes and conventions in a media work you study have been used to create and audience reaction 

Rian Johnsons Film "Brick" is a master work in the way it uses and employs codes and convention to create audience reactions. Even within the opening the scene various visual, audio and symbolic codes are put to use. 

The intro of the movie starts of with an ambient glass bottle ring, played over the top of a girls dead hand in the stream. This ambient glass bottle changes pitch with a legato feel. It then settles in to a classic motif, the 3,2,1. This glass bottle "321" simple melodic device is used to be reminiscent of classic children nursery rhymes such as three blind mice and hot cross buns. This being played over the dead girl with her hand in the scene, evokes a sense of innocence and childlike nature surrounding the girl, portraying her as innocent and little. This leads to the audience feeling sympathetic towards the girl and feeling as if she did not deserve this death. 

Another code that is employed to further support this audience reaction is symbolic codes. Rian Johnson has strategically employed the use of colour to evoke an emotional response. The girls hand seen in the intro is seen to be wearing a blue bracelet. This bracelets colour is symbolic in the sense that it is used to also create a further sense of innocence, sadness and remorse within the audience. Blue is often used in connotation with sadness to create and emotional response and has been exploited by Rian Johnson to create this impact on the viewer.
