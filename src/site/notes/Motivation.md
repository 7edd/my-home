# What is motivation 
- Conscious or unconscious drive leading our behaviours
- A reason or reasons for acting or behaving in a particular way 
- The process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviours 
- The impetus that gives purpose or direction to behaviour and operates in humans at a conscious or unconscious level

Motives are frequently divided into physiological, primary or organic motives, such as hunger thirst, and need for sleep; and personal, social, or secondary motives, such as affiliation, competition, and individual interests and goals, an important distinction must also be drawn between internal motivating forces and external factors, such as rewards or punishments, that can encourage or discourage certain behaviours

## Sources of motivation 

- **Physiological** – necessary for survival such as hunger, thirst, sleep

- **Cognitions** – intellectual challenges and the intrinsic satisfaction they give, to satisfy personal curiosity or to explore out own personal interests.

- **Emotions** – trying to find/increase happiness and avoid pain. Emotions such as fear, anger and happiness can guide our motivations.

- **Social** – it is a human need to be with other people, develop relationships and belong and this need can motivate our behaviours, such as peer pressure and seeking others’ approval

# Psychological needs for motivation 
- It is crucial for individuals to satisfy these three needs 
## Autonomy 
- People have a need to feel that they are the masters of their own destiny and that they have at least some control over their lives; most importantly, people have a need to feel that they are in control of their own behaviour
## Competence
- Another need concerns our achievements, knowledge , and skills; people have a need to build their competence and develop mastery over tasks that are important to them, 
## Relatedness
- People need to have a sense of belonging and connectedness with others; cheac of us needs other people to some degree 

	- Individual differences in personality result from the varying degrees to which each need has been satisfied or thwarted 


## Deci and Ryan 
### Strengths
- Widely applicable across cultures and contexts; the three fundamental psychological needs are views as. Universal intrinsic motivation clearly explains why people participate in activities they personally find enjoyable without needing reward
### Limitation 
- Strong emphasis on autonomy minimises the influence of external rewards on motivation. Multiple components within the theory are quite complex and limit comprehension and ability to apply it.
