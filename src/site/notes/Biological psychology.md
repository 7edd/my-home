# Location, Structure and Function of the Brain

## Syllabus

- Hindbrain – medulla, cerebellum
- Midbrain – reticular formation
- Forebrain – hypothalamus, thalamus
- Cerebral cortex
- Left and right hemispheres – contralateral control of the body
- Corpus callosum
- Lobes of the brain – frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital
- Localisation of functions – Broca’s area, Wernicke’s area, pre-frontal cortex, primary motorcortex, primary sensory cortex, primary auditory cortex, primary visual cortex#

### The Brain Structure

The brain is divided into 3 main physical sections
- Hindbrain – medulla, cerebellum
- Midbrain – reticular formation
- Forebrain – hypothalamus, thalamus

#### Hind Brain

Located at the base of the brain near the back of the skull.  
Controls basic survival functions:
- Heart rate
- Breathing
- Sleep  
Controls voluntary muscle movements and reflexive actions:
- Coughing
- Swallowing
- Vomiting

##### Hind Brain Contains:

**Medulla –** receives signals from spinal cord and regulates vital physiological functions such as: 
- heart beat 
- circulation 
- respiration  
**Cerebellum –** responsible for the coordination of smooth, well-sequenced movement as well as maintaining equilibrium  
- fine motor control 
- coordination

#### Mid Brain

- Section of the brain directly above the brain stem, under cerebral hemispheres.
- Midbrain structures and systems help to keep us alert, awake and vigilant.
- Sensory switchboardreceives messages from all senses (except smell) and sends them on to higher brain regions that deal specifically with hearing, sight, taste and touch.

#### Fore Brain

- Located above the midbrain and is dividend into 2 hemispheres
- Most highly developed and largest part of brain
- Major role in how we think, feel and behave

##### Fore brain Contains:

**Hypothalamus –** peanut sized structure found just below the thalamus; 
- Plays a very important role in control of basic survival actions: sleep, regulation of body temperature, expression of emotions

**Thalamus –**  sits on top of brain stem, consisting of two small egg-shaped structures joined together
- Assists in functions in relaying sensory (exception of smell) messages on their way to the relevant part of the cerebral cortex (outer layer of the brain) where it can be processed into meaningful information.

## Lobes
Subdivided into 4 lobes which are separated by deep fissures/grooves and have separate functions:
### Frontal lobe
Complex mental behaviours such as: 
-   planning
-   problem-solving
-   memory learning 
-   analysing 
-   symbolic thinking
-   Personality and emotional processing (remember Phineas Gage)
### Parietal lobe
-   Mostly associated with processing bodily sensations
-   Touch, temperature, pressure and other bodily sensations relating to muscle and joint movement 
-   We feel sensation and form a perception of what it is and where it came from
	-   ie. matching sight and sound of object
-   Also controls the judgement of texture, weight, size and shape
### Temporal lobe
-   Receive information from both eyes, processes and interprets it
-   Contains:
-   Primary Visual Cortex
-   Where visual info is first received and processed
-   Assembles the bits of visual info into a ‘whole picture’
### Occipital lobe
-   Receive information from both eyes, processes and interprets it
-   Contains:
-   Primary Visual Cortex
-   Where visual info is first received and processed
-   Assembles the bits of visual info into a ‘whole picture’
