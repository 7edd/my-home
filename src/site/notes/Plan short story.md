There it is again, that shack. No matter how far i walk i always end up coming back. I walked for at least 3 hours this time I presume. The waves of heat make the shack barely visible, just a blur of brown and beige, sitting atop a sea of red dirt. The monotony of each step is wearing away at me. My lips are chapped, yet i'm drenched from head to toe in sweat. 

As I continuously step closer and closer to the shack, the familiar cracked wooden planks that make up the walls become clearer. Held together by rusty nails, covered by a piece of sheet metal. My grandfather said he used to come here to clear his head. He would spend days on end in this shack, doing god knows what. No one knows what happened to him, one day he was with us as usual, the next day he was gone. Not a single word.

I don't even know why i came to the shack, it just felt right. The shack is exactly as he described. Antique furniture littered the inside, cobwebs surrounding the corners of everything. Hints of light beam in between the disheveled planks of wood on the wall. I settled down on the floor with just a dusty pillow to spend my third night here. The desert winds rumble the shack at night. Outside the shack is a water spout, poking out of the red sand, only letting out a trickle of water at a time, yet constantly dripped throughout the night. 

Just as every morning, I arose of the ground, my back killing from the long night on the wood floor. I step out into the sun, the heat hits me like a truck. I just want to leave. 

The calluses on my feet building stronger the longer i walk. I almost find peace in the routine of the walk. Not expecting a change. And as always I end up back at the shack. This time it was 30 minutes before I ended up back. I stop for water and continue in another direction. Being left alone with my thoughts, my brain deprived of stimulus, just pure thought. I usually think of my grandfather.
