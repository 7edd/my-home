# Rehearsal 
- There are 2 types of rehearsal: **maintenance** and **elaborate**
### Maintenance rehearsal 
- The straight repetition of information to memorise it. 
- This type of rehearsal can be mental, where you're thinking about and repeating the information in your mind. It can also be verbal, where you're speaking and repeating the information aloud.
	- Eg, repeating the digits of a phone number until you dial them.

### Elaborate rehearsal 
- Involves linking new information to information you already know. It is more complex than maintenance rehearsal. 
- Different encoding strategies can be used to link new to existing knowledge
- Strategies may include
	- Organising information 
	- Thinking of examples 
	- Creating an image in your head

# Ebbinghaus
- His research produced the forgetting curve - a visual representation of the way that learned information fades over time. 
## Forgetting curve 
- Ebbinghaus experimented with his own ability to remember using a list of nonsense syllables, which he attempted to recall after different lengths of time, his experiences and results revealed a number of key aspects which led to his construction of the forgetting curve: 
- **Memories weaken over time.** If we learn something new, but then make no attempt to relearn that information, we remember less and less of it as the hours, days and weeks go by. 
- **The biggest drop in retention happens soon after learning.** This is reflected by the steep fall at the start of the forgetting curve. Without reviewing or reinforcing our learning , our ability to retain the information plummets. For example, you may leave a class with you head full of new facts and figures, only to find that you can remember very little of it just hours later.

## Spaced repetition
- In his research Ebbinghaus also highlighted several things that we can do to retain information for longer. In this section, we look at four strategies you can use to improve your power of recall such as ‘spaced learning’ or repetition.
### Use of spaced repetition
- Ebbinghaus found by reviewing new information at key moments on the Forgetting Curve, you can reduce the rate at which you forget it.
- This approach of repetition of learning at certain intervals is often referred to as "spaced repetition" or "distributive practice."
