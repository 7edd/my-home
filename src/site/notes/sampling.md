# Sampling Methods 
## Convenience 
- Where the researcher chooses participants because they are readily available.
#### Strengths 
- Quick and inexpensive way to select sample 
#### Limitations 
- Sample may not be representative of population/ bias in sample this can negatively affect the generalisability of the samples result to wider population being studied 
---
## Snowballing 
- Is a non probability sample method where currently enrolled research participants help recruit further participants.
- Used when researchers have difficulty finding participants for their study 
#### Strengths 
- Enables access to hidden populations 
#### Limitations 
- Difficult to determine sampling error 
- Bias is possible
- Not always representative of greater population 
---
## Random sampling 
- Is a sampling procedure in which the sample is chosen by chance from the population. It results in every member of the population having equal chance of being selected. 
#### Strengths 
- Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This potentially results in the sample being representative. Can reduce experimenter bias in sample selection. 
#### Limitations 
- Difficult to achieve - very time consuming for large population 
- Sample may not be representative of the population which can in turn effect generalisability 
---
## Stratified sampling
- Researchers divide population into subgroups and chooses the sample based on same proportion
- This ensures that the sample grou contains the same proportions as found in  the population 
- Stratified sampling procedures is most commonly used when psychological characteristics pr attitudes vary greatly among subgroups
#### Strengths
- The sample should be highly representative of the target population and therefore we can generalise from the result obtained 
- Eliminated the effect of the variable on which the sample is stratified
#### Limitations 
- Time consuming, expensive

# Allocation of Participants
## Random allocation 
- Where participants are assigned to groups by methods which use chance. 
- All participants who have been selected for an experiment have an equal chance of being in the experimental group or control group 
	- When sample is large enough, both the experimental and control group will be equivalent on all participant characteristics 
	- The presence or absence of the IV will be the only difference between them
