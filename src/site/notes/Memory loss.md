# Causes of memory loss 
### multiple theories of memory loss
⁃	trauma - damage to the brain through traumatic occurrences (can be singular such as a car accident, or multiple such as sports - ETC)
⁃	degeneration - memory loss over time due to neurone slowly decaying 
⁃	drug induced - can be temporary while under the influence of drugs, or permanent due to neural damage caused by drug use/misuse/abuse

# Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)
⁃	progressive brain disease associated with repeated trauma to the brain, gets worse over time 
⁃	causes the death of nerve cells in the brain, known as degeneration 
⁃	not fully understood, definitive diagnose only able to be done post-mortem in an autopsy 
⁃	when the symptoms associated with CTE occur, health care providers may diagnose traumatic encephalopathy syndrome 
⁃	repeated trauma often associated with spots
⁃	does not seem to be related to a single injury, only repeated 
⁃	causes problems with cognition and memory, physical problems 
⁃	symptoms develop years to decades after the head traumas 
⁃	degeneration of brain cells caused by CTE believed to relate to development of memory problems 
⁃	links to dementia 
⁃	there is no cure for CTE

## four stages of cte 
⁃	Stage 1 
⁃	headaches, loss of attentions, some short term memory issues 
⁃	stage 2 
⁃	depression, mood swings, short term memory loss 
⁃	stage 3 
⁃	memory loss, executive dysfunction, aggression, visiospatioal difficulties 
⁃	stage 4 
⁃	severe cognitive problems an memory loss, dementia, language difficulties 

# Drug induced memory loss 
## WKS (Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome)
- WKS is the combined name for two different stages of a related syndrome - Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff amnesic syndrome 

- Most commonly associated with alcohol use disorder, but can also be a side effect of chemotherapy and other conditions where the body struggles to absorb food properly 
- Wernickes encephalopathy is mostly curable 
- Korsakoffs amnesic syndrome is NOT curable and may lead to death 

Caused by a thiamine (vitamin B 1) deficiency leading to degeneration of brain cells 
	Long term alcohol use irritates your stomach and digestive tract, it also interferes. With you body's ability to absorb vitamins. And estimated 80% of people with alcohol addiction don't absorb or retain enough thiamine. 

- Difficulty in forming new memories and retrieving stored memories 
- Degeneration of brain cells within thalamus, hypothalamus and mammillary bodies 
- Wernickes encephalopathy represent the "acute" phase of the disorder 
	- Mental confusion, vision problems, coma, hypothermia, low blood pressure, lack of muscle coordination 
	- Most symptoms of WE can be reversed if detected and treated promptly and completely 
- KA syndrome is the chronic or long lasting stage 
	- Problems in acquiring new information or establishing new memories, and in retrieving previous memories 
	- Amnesia, tremor, coma, disorientation, vision problems 
	- Irreparable damage, without treatment these disorders can be disabling and life threatening
