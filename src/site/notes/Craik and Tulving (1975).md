# Aim 
Craik and Tulving wanted to test wether the level of processing affected how well we remember information 
	By "depth of processing", we mean, the way in which a person thinks about a piece of information 

# Method 
## Participants 
- Sample: 24 male and female students from university of Toronto 
- Sampling method: convenience sampling
## Materials
- List of 60 words 
- Set of 3 questions 
- List of 180 words that incorporated original 60 
## Design 
- Iv: type of encoding used to memorise list of words; **structural encoding** vs **phenomic encoding** vs **semantic encoding** 
- Dv: number of words recalled
## Procedure 
- Participants told study testing perception 
- **Randomly allocated** into one of three conditions 
- All participants provided with list of 60 words and required to answer 1 question for each word 
	- Participants in **structural coding** conditions asked "is the word in capital letters or lower case"
	- In **phonemic coding** conditions asked "does the word rhyme with ....?"
	- In **semantic coding** condition asked "does the word go in this sentence...?"
- Each participant was given a list of 180 words which included the 60 words on original list provided to participants. They were required to indicate which words were part of the original list of 60 words. 

# Findings 
- Found that participants were better able to recall words which had been processed more deeply - that is, processed semantically, supporting level of processing theory. 
- Words that were semantically encoded via elaborate rehearsal and deep processing had higher recall accuracy. In contrast to words that were structurally or phonetically encoded that had received only shallow processing, resulting in lower recall accuracy
