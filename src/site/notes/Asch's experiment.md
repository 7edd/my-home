# Conformity - Asch

## Overview

Asch’s sample consisted of 50 male students from Swarthmore College in America, who believed they were taking part in a vision test. Asch used a line judgement task, where he placed on real naïve participants in a room with seven confederates (actors), who had agreed their answers in advance.  
The real participant was **deceived** and was led to believe that the other seven people were also real participants. The real participant always sat second to last.

## Aim

to determine if individuals would conform to group pressure 

## Method

- 87 male college students 
- Materials: series of cards each showing a standard line and 3 comparison lines
- Participant was asked to judge the length of lines in a room with several other confederates (actors) who agreed to give incorrect answers. There were 18 trials in total and in 12 critical trials confederates gave wrong answer.

## Key Findings

- Over the 12 critical trials, about 75% of participants conformed at least once, and 25% of participant never conformed. In the control group, with no pressure to conform to confederates, less than 1% of participants gave the wrong answer.

## Contribution to Psychology

- provided insight into the conditions in which people conform and the reasons why people conform

## Criticisms and Limitations of the Study

- Asch used a biased sample as all participants were male college students in the same age group

# To Submit

## IV

The independent variable in Asch's 1955 study is the response of the actor's

## DV

The dependent variable is the subject's response to the same question.

## How DV Will Be Measured.

Measuring the number of times each participant conformed to the majority view.

## Equipment

- Table
- Chairs
- Sheet of paper with questions 

## Step by step Method – how You Will Conduct Your Experiment.

1. Participants: Recruit three groups of 6 students from year 7 Mount Lawley.

2. Setup: Prepare a room with chairs and tables for each participant. Provide a piece of paper and a pen on each table.

3. Instructions: Explain that the study aims to investigate visual perception and judgments.

4. Actors: Recruit 5 actors who will provide predetermined responses during the experiment.

5. Line Judgment Task: display a paper with a target line (Line X) and three comparison lines (Line A, Line B, and Line C).

6. Trials: Conduct 3 trials. Participants compare the target line with the comparison lines and indicate their choice.

7. Actors' Responses: Instruct the actors to provide incorrect answers unanimously on 2 out of 3 trials and the correct answer on 1 trial.

8. Real Participant's Turn: Participants provide their answers after the actors have responded.

9. Data Collection: Collect the completed papers from each participant, including the actors.

10. Control Condition: Conduct a separate session without actors for comparison.

11. Debriefing: Explain the true nature of the study and its purpose.

12. Analysis: Compare the real participants' responses during critical trials with the control condition to assess conformity levels.

















using a lab experiment to study conformity, whereby 3 groups of 7 male students from mount lawley participated in a ‘vision test.’

Using a line judgment task, Asch put a naive participant in a room with seven confederates/stooges. The confederates had agreed in advance what their responses would be when presented with the line task.

The real participant did not know this and was led to believe that the other seven confederates/stooges were also real participants like themselves.

Each person in the room had to state aloud which comparison line (A, B or C) was most like the target line. The answer was always obvious.  The real participant sat at the end of the row and gave his or her answer last.

There were 18 trials in total, and the confederates gave the wrong answer on 12 trials (called the critical trials).  Asch was interested to see if the real participant would conform to the majority view.

Asch’s experiment also had a control condition where there were no confederates, only a “real participant.”
