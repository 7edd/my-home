## Leon Festinger (1919-1989)
- Leon Festinger proposed a theory of cognitive dissonance centred on how people try to reach internal consistency 
- He suggested that people have an inner need to ensure that their beliefs and behaviours are consistent 
- Inconsistent or conflicting beliefs leads to disharmony, which people strive to avoid

### Cognitive dissonance 
- Is when you feel discomfort because there is a conflict between two beliefs, or you act in a way that is inconsistent with your beliefs 
#### How is cognitive dissonance resolved? We alter our cognitions to reduce the discomfort.
1. Modify one or more of our cognitions
2. Trivialise/reduce
3. Adding more cognitions/ acquire new information 
4. Deny 


## Festinger and Carlsmith 

### Aim 
- Festinger and Carlsmith investigated if making people perform a dull task would create cognitive dissonance though forced compliance through forced compliance behaviour 
### Method
- In their laboratory experiment, they used 71 male students as participants to perform a series of dull tasks
- They were then pain either $1 or $20 to tell a waiting participant that the tasks were really interesting 
- Almost all of the participants agreed to walk into the waiting room and persuade the confederate that the boring experiment would be fun 
### Conclusion
- Being paid on 1 dollar is not sufficient incentive for lying and so those who were paid the 1 dollar experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by coming to believe that the task really were interesting and enjoyable.

## Magnitude of dissonance 
- Refers to the level of discomfort caused to the person 
- Inconsistency is a normal part of life and not all inconsistencies produce cognitive dissonance 

## Responses to cognitive dissonance 
- Change action 
- Change perception: smoking causes cancer, but i exercise 
- Change beliefs

## Forced compliance behaviour 
- When someone is forced to do (publicly) something they (privately) really don't want to do, dissonance is created between their cognition and their behaviour 
- Forced compliance occurs when an individual performs an action that is inconsistent with his or her beliefs. The behaviour can't be changed since it was already in the past, so dissonance will need to be reduced by re evaluating their attitude toward what they have done. This prediction has been tested experimentally, eg: Festinger and Carlsmith
