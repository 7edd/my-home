# Retrieval failure
- Retrieval failure is the inability to retrieve a certain piece of information. The memory still exists but we fail to use the right cue to retrieve it. 
- Successful retrieval requires cues that act as mental reminders. The cues cause a search to be activated, transferring likely info from ltm to wm. Without the right cue its difficult to pull the right information out of your memory 

# Interference 
- Suggests forgetting is a result of retrieval difficulties due to competing, similar info being stored. Info isn't lost from storage but cant be successfully retrieved because related or similar info gets mixed up or blocks retrieval 
## Retro active interference 
- Learning of new informations interferes with remembering old 
## Proactive interference 
- Information previously learned interferes with new learning 

# Motivated forgetting
- Theory that there is a strong desire to forget certain things/experiences because is either too traumatic, disturbing, anxiety producing or upsetting
## Repression
- Keeping unpleasant/disturbing memories in the unconscious and from entering ones concious. 
	- Theory of Sigmund Freud 
	- Memories still stand
	- Difficult/resistant to access
	- Can re-enter consciousness through dreams, slip of tongue or under pressure 
	- Believed these repressed memories were tied to underlying cause of psychological distress/disorders
	- Drove rationale for freudian therapies such as hypnosis and speech therapy which aimed to bring repressed memory into consciousness so anxieties. Negative emotions can be dealt with 

## Suppression
- Deliberate effort to keep distressing thoughts out of consciousness
	- 'active' forgetting 
	- Aware of memory but choose not to recall it.
	- Effective dissociative technique 

# Decay theory 
- Forgetting occurs because the memory trace (initially formed at learning) tends to gradually fade or decay over time 
	- This theory assumes memories are not permanent. 
	- Revisiting memories reduces/counteracts decay.
	- Principle cause of forgetting = time 
- Difficult to test or corroborate or disprove 
- Criticism of idea that time is principle cause of forgetting as older memories often retained/ easily retrieved while new memories can be difficult to retrieve.
