# Definition

**Plasticity** – the ability of the brain’s synapses to be modified

- **Infancy** and **adolescence** are periods of rapid development of the brain.
- Developmental plasticity – the ability of the synapses to be modified in an infant or child’s brain
- Changes occur more frequently in the foetal stage, as well as during infancy, childhood and adolescence 
- Adaptive plasticity – the plasticity which occurs thorough life as learning takes place and do not dimmish with age

## Brain Plasticity in Infancy

- Prior to birth and first years of a child’s life neurons are quite flexile in terms of their function. 
- Development oof nervous system starts before birth when brain and spinal cord are formed
- Development then goes through five stages:
1. Proliferation
2. Migration
3. Circuit formation
4. Synaptic pruning
5. Myelination

### Proliferation

is the division and multiplication of the unborn baby’s cells that will become neurons
- This process marks the beginning of the development of the nervous system

### Migration

during developmental plasticity, the movement of newly formed neurons 
- Newly formed neurons move outward to their destined location
- Role of particular neuron might be determined by where it is located at the time of its formation.

### Circuit Formation

Circuit formation – a process that involves axons of new neurons growing out to target cells, forming new synapses
- Forming new synapses also known as **synaptogenesis**

### Synaptic Pruning
the loss of excess neurons and synapses usually formed in infancy and childhood
- The synapses which have not established a connection with a neighbouring cell will die
- Nervous system refines itself by strengthening or weakening synapses according to whether their presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons fire together

### Myelination
Myelination – the production of the white, fatty covering that insulates a neuron’s axon, speeds transmission and aids coordination
-   Final stage before the brain becomes fully mature

## Brain Plasticity in adolescence 
Effects of changes in brain structures on behaviour and emotion 

### Cerebellum :
There is an increase in the number of neurons and synapses in the cerebellum the part of the brain responsible for balance, muscle tone and the performance of motor skills.

### Amygdala :
The amygdala becomes more active in adolescence.

### Corpus callosum:
The corpus callosum thickens and there is an increase in the number of connections between the two hemispheres.

### Frontal lobe:
The Frontal lobe is responsible for motor movement and higher order thinking.
