# construct and interpret data displays
## graphs – scatterplot, bar, column, line, histogram
###     Column Graph 
- commonly used to display results from experimental research (IV is on x-axis and DV is on y-axis)
-   Bars are oriented vertically with gaps between
-   Data is discrete

### Histogram
- typically used to display frequency distributions
- Bars touch each other
- Data is continuous

### Line Graph 
- commonly used to display results from experimental research 
-   Both variables are either increasing or decreasing at regular increments
-   Almost always used to show change over time 
-   Data is continuous 

### Scatterplot 
- used to display results from correlational research
-   There are no IV or DV, only pre-existing variables
-   Can plot variable on either axis
- 
## tables – summary, frequency
- calculate and interpret the mean and median as measures of central tendency
- interpret Pearson’s correlation coefficient as a measure of strength and direction of linear relationships
