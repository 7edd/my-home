# Nina Simone (1933-2003) To Be Young, Gifted and Black (1969)

## Key info 
#### Context 
- Born in North Carolina 
- Played Piano in church, - Gospel relation 
- Born into a state with continued racial violence 
- Attended Juilliard school of music 

### Song
- **After the furious song ‘Mississippi Goddam’ and other songs of struggle and discrimination, ‘To Be Young, Gifted and Black’, focuses on the hope of youth, and the imperative to not define blackness as inherent struggle: ‘There’s a world waiting for you/ This is a quest that’s just begun’.**

-  The song in question was a collaboration between Nina Simone and Weldon J. Irvine Jr., with Irvine writing the lyrics. Unlike some of Simone's other songs that addressed civil rights and oppression, this piece is more about hope and the potential for a better future, though it does touch on haunting themes in its final verse. 

- It's not a lament or a direct call to action but rather celebrates black culture and identity, emphasising solidarity and positivity.

- "Young, Gifted and Black" conveys hope through the perspective of youth, a common theme in Civil Rights movements.

- The theme of youth as hope is present in various contexts, including contemporary movements like the Uluru Statement from the Heart.  ** <font size=1> The Uluru Statement from the Heart is a 2017 petition to the people of Australia, written and endorsed by the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders selected as delegates to the First Nations National Constitutional Convention. </font>
- 
- "To Be Young, Gifted and Black" is unique in its targeted audience, addressing exclusively African Americans rather than society at large or white Americans.

- The use of "you" in the song's second verse, "There’s a world waiting for you," differs significantly from the use of "you" in Nina Simone's "Mississippi Goddam," where it refers to a broader societal or white American audience.

- This distinction highlights the song's focus on empowering and uplifting the African American community specifically, rather than appealing to a broader audience or addressing systemic issues with society as a whole.
## Comparative works 
- Billie Holiday - Strange Fruit 
- James Brown – ‘Say it Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud’ (1968)
- Any other Nina Simone song, Missisipi Goddamn, Strange fruit ect. 

## Analysis
#### Form 
- **Strophic Form** - AAA
- Comparing the melodic contour of the final verse to the first two verses. Simone sings a fairly different melody, which mimics somewhat the improvisation style of early jazz and vocalists from the earlier parts of the twentieth century.
	- **Jazz influence, African American identity **
## Instrumentation 
- Simone performs on piano and is accompanied by a range of male and female singers. 

- There is an ensemble who acts as backing for Simone, featuring saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and rhythm section. 
	- **Jazz, gospel instrumentation, African American identity**
- There is a prominent vibraphone present in the studio recording. This instrument had been popularised in jazz through its use in the Modern Jazz Quartet.

## Harmony 
- Simple, less adventurous harmony 
- However, referring to the version of the score selected by SCSA for study, there are a number of chords listed with extensions. These chords (e.g. Eaug7 b. 10 and G11 b. 31) highlight the jazz harmonic sensibilities of Simone  
	- **Jazz influence, African American identity, Nina Simones context.**
