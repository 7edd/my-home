# Social Influence Theory

## **Social influence**

- occurs when the real or implied presence of people influence the behaviour and attitudes of others.
- Obedience and conformity are types of social influences. [[Conformity and obedience\|Conformity and obedience]]

### **Herbert Kelman (1958)

- People change their attitudes and beliefs, and consequently their behaviours, due to social influence.

**There are 3 social influence processes and each of them can be viewed as a different level at which individuals accept that they have been influenced

## Compliance

an individual changes attitudes or behaviour with the aim of being rewarded by, or avoiding punishment  
from, a person or group, or to gain approval or avoid disapproval from them.

### Influence Agent

- people who have the power to reward and punish (eg emergency services, boss at work, etc)

#### Eg

- Slowing down when someone sees a speed camera on the freeway. The individual may not believe there should be set speed limits on the freeway, but they slow down to avoid receiving a fine

## Identification

- identification arises when people change their attitudes or behaviours because they want to **establish or sustain a satisfying relationship with another person. 
- The relationship may be reciprocal, where there is a mutual exchange between them, or the person may want to be like the other person. 

### Influencing Agent

- people that others believe having a relationship with would be attractive and important (eg a personal trainer helping someone reach their fitness goals, or a lawyer helping gain custody of their children)

#### Eg

- Students cooperating with their teachers and forming a positive rapport with them in order to receive resources, mentoring, and help with course.

---

## Internalisation

- the individual accepts influence because the attitude or behavior of the group is in line with those of the individual

### Influencing Agent

- people who have credibility due to being trustworthy and an expert in their field (eg a medical practitioner).

#### Eg

- People who take their cat to a vet for yearly check-up and follow the vets’ health care advice if they client shares the same attitude of the vet, that preventative care is important.

# **Strengths Of theory**

- Can be tested experimentally and its effects can be observed and provide empirical evidence

# **Limitation Of theory**

- Model is not intended to apply to all changes in attitude resulting from social interaction

# **Application Of Theory to Real-world context**

- Developing policies for educational institutions such as universities (eg mentors, consequences for plagiarism (compliance))
