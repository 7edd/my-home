# Eight dimensions of wellbeing 
## Physical Wellbeing
- Physical wellness is achieved through a combination of good eating habits, regular exercise, and quality sleep. Optimising your physical health also includes avoiding the consumption of anything that can cause harm long-term, such as processed sugars, recreational drugs, or excessive alcohol use.
## Emotional/Mental Wellbeing
- Emotional and mental wellbeing is the ability to manage your feelings and reactions effectively. A person who is emotionally well is aware and sensitive of the fact that each of us experiences a wide range of emotions.
## Intellectual Wellbeing
- The intellectual dimension places emphasis on ways to expand knowledge and skills through intellectually stimulating activities.
## Environmental Wellbeing
- The environments you spend the most time in, such as your home or at work, significantly affect your mood and overall wellbeing.
## Occupational Wellbeing
- Engaging in work that is meaningful to you allows you to live aligned with your values and passions. When you’re working without passion for what you do, the work can feel draining and tiresome.
## Social Wellbeing
- Social wellness helps us to develop a sense of connection, belonging, and a well-developed support system. After all, social support is one of the most fundamental human needs.
## Spiritual Wellbeing
- The spiritual dimension recognises our need to find meaning and purpose as part of our human experience. Fulfilling your spiritual needs can help you feel more connected to yourself and those around you.
## Financial Wellbeing
- Financial security is something we all hope to achieve. Each of us wants to feel that we can enjoy our lives without having to worry too much about our current or future financial situation.

# Wellbeing and happiness
- Happiness and Wellbeing are not the same thing. 
	- Happiness is a positive emotion/feeling that comes from **experiencing joy, contentment, or satisfaction.** Wellbeing, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses not only happiness but also **the overall quality of our lives**.
- Researchers often use happiness and wellbeing interchangeably
