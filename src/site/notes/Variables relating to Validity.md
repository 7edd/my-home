# Extraneous Variable

- A variable, other than the IV (independent variable), that has the potential to cause changes in the value of the DC

# Confounding Variable

- A variable, other than the IV, that has a systemic effect on the value of the DV. If a confounding variable exist, no valid conclusion about the research can be drawn 

## Confounding Variable

- Have an effect on the DV
- Have a relationship association (even if only correlational) with IV
- Can lead to 
1. association between IV and DV being spurious and solely result of effect of confounding variable (like shark attacks and ice cream consumption, when in fact its summer)  
OR
2. causal effect of IV on V to be exaggerated/decreased by effect of confounding variable (there is a relationship between IV and DV, confounding exaggerates it and reduces [[Validity & Reliability\|Validity & Reliability]])

### Confounding Variables Must Be Eliminated through Experimental Design to Ensure Experiment is Actually Measuring the Effect of the IV and VD Validity and not the Effect of the Confounding Variable
