# Memory 
- The internal record of some previous event, a process in which information is encoded, stored and retrieved. 
## Encoding
	the conversion of information into a form that can be stored by the brain 

## Storage 
	information that is held for various amounts of time 

## Retrieval
	the process that locates stored informationa and returns it to conciousnesss as required 

# Multi store model of memory (atkinson and shiffrin 1968)
- 3 seperate stage 
	 Sensory memory
	 Short term memory 
	 Long term memory

### Sensory memory
Refers to info from the senses 
Allows you to develop a representation of stimulus 
Main function is to hold incoming info long enough to be processed further. 
5 seperate sensory registers act as temporary storage bins for the different sense. 
Info remains in sensory register for varying amounts of time 
#### Iconic memory
 - Visual memories
#### Echoic memory
- Sound/auditory memories 

Info that is considered important is attended to and passed onto short term memory 

#### Encoding 
- Rapid based on physical properties of the stimulus 
- Helps us experience a constant flow of info 
- Selective attention focusses your mental resources on only some of the sensory stimuli 

## Short term memory
- Refers to the info you are aware of. The current thoughts, words and images available for decision making and problem solving
- Working memory is the current, preferred term of STM. Essentially there is a consistent back and forth of information between the areas. It allows us to mentally work with or manipulate info. 
#### Storage capacity 
Stores between 5-9 chunks of info 7 plus or minus 2 
- Greatest for digits
- Lowest for letters/words (the longer the less remembered)
- Better for info we hear than info we see 

#### Storage duration 
- Approximately 30 s 
- 5-18 without rehearsal 
- Adaptive (gets rid of useless info)
- Can also be inconvenient 
### Rehearsal 
- Rehearsal enables info to be retained in working memory for longer than usual and to transfer material to long term memory,
#### Maintenance rehearsal 
- Remembering info for immediate use, not to transfer to Long Term Memory. Often just repeating 

#### Elaborate rehearsal
- The active processing and encoding of info by associating it with other info in LYM to make it more meaningful so it can be stored in LTM for later use.

#### Chunking 
Chunking is also used to increase working memory capacity 
George miller 1956
- The process of combining info into larger, meaningful groups based on patterns 
- Short term memory has the capacity to remember 5-9 chunks of meaningful info though the size of the chunks vary greatly 

### Primary recency effect 
- More likely to remember the first things on a list than the middle terms 

### Recency effect 
- Last items on a list are easily remembered is called the recency effect
#### Serial positioning effect 
- Umbrella term for these 2 terms
