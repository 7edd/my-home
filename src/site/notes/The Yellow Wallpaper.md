## Symbols 
#### The wallpaper 
The pattern of the wallpaper symbolises the narrators confinement, social limitations of women.  The pattern traps and fixates the narrators thoughts, such as the rest cure seems to drive her insane. Comes to see the wallpaper as bars imprisoning women. Tearing the paper symbolises her own desire to free herself from her confinement.
#### The estate 
Reflects the narrators own isolation. Boundries of the garden, house and room, symbolise the ever smaller spaces of her physical and mental freedom. 
#### The moon 
The moon with its monthly phases long connected with a womens menstrul cycle, serves as symbolic representation of womanhood. The moon first reveals wallpapers sub patter. Making a connection with the narrator and the woman in the wall. 
#### The patriarchy 
The patriarchy is symbolically represented by john, being a physician, his power, practicalness and straight forward simplistic ideologies, reflect the attitudes and institutionalised discrimination that women faced in the 19 th century. John being the antithesis of his wifes “fanciful” and emotionally complex nature. The control that john has over his wife is a direct allegory for the control and male domination of the 19 th century. 

## Themes 
#### Conformity vs self expression 
Can be seen in the dynamic between the narrator and john. As a wife and a woman she must conform to societys norms. Uncerstanding and following everything john says due to him being her husband and also a physitian. Narrator accepts her role, but writes secrelty to express her self. But this need for healthy self expression is not met. The narrater comes to see a confined women behind the bars. Shows how unhealthy forced conformity can be.

#### Confinement 
Seen in the setting, the form or the journal and the narraters overall decent into maddness. Borders and walls of the estate isolate her. The barred windows. Not just physical barriers, are those set up by society to limit women. Her journal sets the confines of her mental activity. Confined by her fixation of the wallpaper. The pattern traps her mind. 

#### Womens roles 
At the time, womens domestic roles were already limited, but the narrator in the story is furthermore limited, at the mercy of physicians who perscribe total inactivity. She is already removed from her roles of mother and house manager. Her womans identity is then split, being pushed onto other characters, mary takes on the role as mother and jennie takes care of the house and narrator, she loses all agency of her life and treated as a child. Gillman had strong opinions on the need for womens need for meaningfull work. 

#### Mental illness 
Is shown to result due to her forced conformity, confinment and limited responsibilites.

# Practice 
Analyse how the use of voice or narrative point of view affected the representation of attitudes in one text.

Representation of attitudes
- Societies attitudes towards woman, aswell as females personal feelings about the power imbalance. 
- Representing gillmans negative attitude toward Womens roles in society 

Tone: Anxious in the begining, yet optimistic. However, as the story progresses, the tone becomes darker, reflecting her anger and misery. Jane begins the story being articulate, well spoken and has high admiration to the natural beauty and scenery of her location. *“Out of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.”* Her tone and voice begin to become much more hysterical and erratic. She also uses words with negative connotations such as fungus, suicide, destroy, and lurid.
