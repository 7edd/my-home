# Sleep 
- A condition of body and mind that typically recurs for several hours every night, in which the eyes are closed. The postural muscles are relaxed, the activity of the brain altered, and consciousness of the surroundings practically suspended 
- Sleep is defined as a reversible behavioural state of percptual disengagement from, and unresponsiveneddto , the environment. 

## Purpose of sleep 
### Evolutionary 
- Theory stating that sleep serves as a means to increase an animals chance of survival in itts environment. 
	- Evolved around the circadian day-night period to match periods of light and darkness 
	- Early humans used daytime rather than night to eat, drink and reproduce as there was a greater risk of injury and predators in the dark which threatened survival, humans are largely visual animals not well adapted to searching for food in the dark or protecting ourselves from nocturnal predetors 
	- Sleeping at night allowed for energy to be conserved 

### Restorative 
- Theory that sleep allows us to recharge our bodies, and recover from the physical and psychological work during the day; it also allows our bodys growth process to occur
- Homeostatis of the body is distrupted when humans are awake and sleep acts to resore it 
- Sleeping allows the energy levels that decilne during wake to be restored 
- Repais and replenishes the body and prepares it for action the next day, also increases our immunity to diseases and recorvert from illness 
- Activities that are more physically demanding increase the need for sleep 
- Increase alreness, keeping our minds alret, and increase mood  
- As well as many neuro transmitters, sleep activeates our grouwth hormone which is responisble for our phuysical growth and metabolism

## Sleep wake cycle 
- Sleep wake cycle - recurring pattern of wakefulness and sleep that individuals undergo on a daily basis 
- Usually measured by recording the times of regualr events such as when we eat and go to sleep 
- Reguklated by the circadian rhythm, which is regulated by body tempurature, metabolic reate, and release of hormones including melatonin 
- Naturally our body clock tends to run to a 24-25 hour clock but this would not line up with preiods of light and dark in a day 

## Stages of the sleep cycle 
Each sleep cycle is made up of distinct stages; three stages of non rapid eye movement and one stage of rapid eye movement 
	- Older classifications had four stages of nrem sleep, however, this has been readjusted 
- These stages allow the brain to recuperate from the day and support multiple functions
- It is not purely length of sleep but also quality of sleep that is vital to restorative processes, progressing through multiple sleep cycles (each made up of the four stages)
- In a night, we go through 4-6 sleep cycles, lasting approximately 90mins each, but the cycles change as we progress through our nightly sleep 
- Stages are identified by characteristics - sleep state, heart rate, eye movement, muscle tension
- The higher the stage or NREM, the harder it is to wake a person up

## NREM SLEEP 
- Divided into three stages 
- Accounts for 75-80% of sleep time 
- Typically first half of the night has more NREM sleep than the second half
- Each stage is indicative of a deeper sleep, with N1 being the lightest and N3 being the heaviest
	- As we get deeper into sleep, brain waves get slower and bigger, heart rate slows and blood pressure drops

- **Originally thought to be divided into 4 stages, however N3 and N4 have since been combined**

### Stage 1 (N 1)
- When a person first falls asleep 
	- Lasts **one to seven** minutes 
		- 5% of your sleeping time 
- Body has not fully relaxed 
	- Body and brain activities do start to slow 
- Easy to wake someone in this stage
	- If not disturbed, someone can quickly fall into stage 2 

### Stage 2 (N 2, NREM 2) 
- Body enters a subdued state,
	- Drop in tempurature, relaxed muscles and slowed breathing and heart rate 
- New brain wave pattern and eye movement stops 
- **brain activity slows, but there are short bursts of activity that actually help resist being woken up by external stimuli.**`

***Stage 2 sleep can last for 10 to 25 minutes during the first sleep cycle, and each N2 stage can become longer during the night. Collectively, a person typically spends about half (45-50%) their sleep time in N2 sleep (the most of any stage).***

### Stage 3 (Deep Sleep)

- harder to wake someone up if they are in this phase. Muscle tone, pulse, and breathing rate decrease in N3 sleep as the body relaxes even further.

- The brain activity during this period has an identifiable pattern of what are known as delta waves. For this reason, stage 3 may also be called delta sleep or slow-wave sleep (SWS).
- **stage is critical for restorative sleep** allowing for recovery and growth 

***You spend the most time in deep sleep during the first half of the night. During the early sleep cycles, N3 stages commonly last for 20 to 40 minutes. As you continue sleeping, these stages get shorter, and more time gets spent in REM sleep instead. It makes up about 25% of your total sleep time in adults.***

### REM Sleep 
- Accounts for 20-25% of our total sleep time
- Defined by spontaneous bursts of rapid eye movement during which the eyeballs quickly move beneath the closed eyelids, darting back and forth, up and down in jerky, but coordinated movements
- Body’s internal functioning is more active than during NREM sleep – heart rate is faster and more irregular, blood pressure rises, breathing shallower, faster and more irregular
- *However, sleeper looks totally relaxed*
- Most dreaming occurs in this stage, dreams can occur in any sleep stage, but they are less common and less intense in the NREM periods.

***REM sleep periods lengthen and occur closer together as sleep continues***
