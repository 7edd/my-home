# Background

## UWA Notes Summarised (Not Analysis section)

### General Notes

- Take the “A” Train is a swing era classic that became known as the ‘signature’ tune of the jazz orchestra of Edward Kennedy ‘Duke’ Ellington

- For your ATAR exam you will be studying Ella Fitzgerald’s 1957 recording of this piece, but original recording is relevant. 

### Historical Background

- 1930s America
- time of racial segregation, where African Americans were excluded from social and educational spaces occupied by white Americans, and they suffered a huge range of other injustices that were, in many cases, enshrined in law. 
- Time of economic recession—the massive Wall Street stock market crash had occurred in 1929, 
- A global economic recession that played out over the course of the 1930s. 
- Time of Prohibition, which was a period of heavy restrictions on the sale of alcohol in the USA.

### Swing

- The social phenomenon was swing. Swing was a popular form of social dance in the 1930s and 40s, and it also named the style of jazz music played for it.
- Swing usually has 4 beats in the bar (as opposed to the 2-beat rhythms of pre-swing jazz), and includes riff-based choruses and call on response gestures, as well as improvised solos over driving accompaniments, and it often had a prominent rhythmic drive, appropriate to its function as dance music.

### Duke Ellington

- Ellington had a massive influence on jazz history, through his band’s performances and recordings, through his compositions, and through the celebrity force of his personality. 
- Unlike a number of other figures who became prominent in jazz history, Duke Ellington was not born into poverty and was not self-taught. He was born into a middle-class African American family in Washington in 1899. 
- He was originally named Edward Kennedy Ellington, but was nicknamed Duke during childhood, apparently due to his air of sophistication.
- Ellington played at social events in his late teens with his first band, called ‘The Duke’s Coloured Syncopators’, who then went on to play larger gigs in New York. He began recording, and with a new manager Irving Mills in the late 1920s Ellington was on his way to becoming a well-known figure.
