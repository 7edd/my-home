# Representation

Within brick there is a lot of female representation yet that can also be negative. In the way that Rian Johnson writes these female characters it leans into negative stereotypes surrounding women, making them villainous, portraying them negatively. This lack of positive representation can lead to a negative audience response from people who are attentive and care for positive female representation within media. The main female within the film act as a "femme fatal". This negative representation leads to is seeming as Rian Johnson views females as nothing but people looking for power.

# Control and Constraints

The controls and constraints limit the scope of a media producers’ creative freedoms, however, overcoming the controls and constraints forces media producers to be creative in ways that they may not have otherwise considered.

## Control and Constraints within Brick

- Brick was written by Johnson in high school. It was made with a very small budget ($450,000) and involved a largely inexperienced cast and crew.

**Controls**: Johnson had  very few (low) controls over his film. This was due to there being no studio to control his decisions. His largest controls were;

- Rules and laws governing the use of school property for film.
- Laws governing the hours and conditions that cast and crew could work. (Occupational Health and Safety)
- General film permits in California governing filming in public settings.
- Without significant controls, Rian Johnson was empowered to act as the film’s auteur.

**Constraints**: Johnson suffered high constraints;

- Low budget, which led to cheap equipment, set and costume options.
- Limited experience for all cast and crew.
- Lack of distribution for the film.
- Due to high constraints, Johnson was forced to compromise on many aspects of his artistic vision.

- Raised money with the help of friends and family  

## Constraints impact and results
Filmed movie in the home town, also used his own high school due to limited budget
- Filmed in narrow windows, houses about to be demolished, construction zones. Lead to lots of planning. 

Whole movie was filmed within 20 days, this was due to limited set access so they had to be precise and prepared for their shots, and did minimal retakes. 

**Edited** by Rian Johnson, due to high budget constraints, yet also allowed for the intended vision to be portrayed  

Costumes bought from thrift stores, yet this led the movie to having a timeless feel to it, allowing for Rian Johnsons vision to still be portrayed even though the budget was limited.

Used to portray the atmosphere, build rising tension, make the film more gritty and real.

# Short Answer revision PRACTICE (ask for feedback if possible)

Rian Johnsons Film "Brick" is a film that masterfully employs codes and conventions create audience reactions. Even within the opening the scene various visual, audio and symbolic codes are put to use. 

Rian Johnsons film is set in a high school, which could lead the audience into thinking that the film would adhere to cliche high school film archetypes, yet this couldn't be further from the truth. Rian Johnson has purposely used the intro of the film to set the tone, ideas and purpose of the film. The intro of the movie starts of with an ambient glass bottle ring, played over the top of a girls dead hand in the stream. This ambient glass bottle changes pitch with a legato feel. It then settles in to a classic motif, the 3,2,1. This glass bottle "321" simple melodic device is used to be reminiscent of classic children nursery rhymes such as three blind mice and hot cross buns. This being played over the dead girl with her hand in the scene, evokes a sense of innocence and childlike nature surrounding the girl, portraying her as innocent and little. This leads to the audience feeling sympathetic towards the girl and feeling as if she did not deserve this death.

Another code that is employed to further support this audience reaction is symbolic codes. Rian Johnson has strategically employed the use of colour to evoke an emotional response. The girls hand seen in the intro is seen to be wearing a blue bracelet. This bracelets colour is symbolic in the sense that it is used to also create a further sense of innocence, sadness and remorse within the audience. Blue is often used in connotation with sadness to create and emotional response and has been exploited by Rian Johnson to create this impact on the viewer.

These uses of symbolic and audio codes have been used to set the narrative and impact the audience into subverting their preconceived ideas on what the movie is about. It serves to shock the audience in a way so as to change the perception of the following scenes within the film, allowing for a more controlled audience response so as to convey the main idea without allowing for the audience to have preconceived notions on the film. 

### Previous feedback on first draft 

**_Comments_**
_Hi Ted, there’s no need to “fluff” the film as it being a “master work” could be contended by an examiner unless you can prove it. Beware of hyperbole! You could make a softer statement such as “masterfully employs codes and conventions”._

_Solid use of example. Including an overview of the film and the necessity of this scene to achieve a particular response in the context of the greater narrative will help you reach the “analyse” level._

_Would love to see the same level of terminology from media as music, but that’s wishful thinking!_
