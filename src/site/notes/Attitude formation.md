## Explicit attitudes vs Implicit attitudes 

### Explicit attitudes 
- made a conscious level
- Deliberately formed and easy to detect and self report
- These are conscious and chosen 
- Result in the behaviours that others see.

### Implicit attitudes
- Unconscious level.
- They form involuntarily, usually unknown to us.

## Attitudes
Your attitudes affect your behaviour. They are intimately woven into your actions and views of the world.

Your states, friendship votes, preferences, and goals are all influenced by your attitudes.

Attitudes can cause a person to respond in a positive or negative way. 

## Attitude formation 
Given the complex nature of attitude formation, it can be difficult to determine the influence of each component. As attitudes are learned the effects of experience, personal influence and exposure to media need to be considered in determining the reason for formation of the attitude.
