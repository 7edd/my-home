# Context and background 
- Breaking Bad is a neo-Western crime dramaÂ created by American filmmaker Vince Gilligan. Breaking Bad focuses in on the town of Albuquerque in New Mexico in 2008 and 2010. Breaking Bad follows the story of Walter White, a disgruntled high school chemistry teacher who slowly becomes a ruthless and savage kingpin within the methamphetamine drug trade, after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and needing to provide for his family. 

# Thesis 
- Breaking Bad is an amazing TV drama which would be great for the ATAR course as it is a great examples of how  themes and representation of ideas and attitudes can be encoded into deeper parts of the show. Breaking Bad employs copious amount of generic and genre conventions and stylistic features to represent these ideas and attitudes towards the audience.
