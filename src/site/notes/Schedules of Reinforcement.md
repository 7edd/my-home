## Info 
- Skinner discovered that how and when a behaviour is reinforced could influence how resistant it was to extinction. He found that a partial schedule of reinforcement (reinforcing a behaviour only part of the time) helped reduce the chances of extinction. Rather than reinforcing the behaviour each and every time it occurs, the reinforcement is given only after a certain amount of time has elapsed or a certain number of responses have occurred. 
- Schedules of reinforcement are rules that control the delivery of reinforcement.  The rules specify either the time that reinforcement is to be made available, or the number of responses to be made, or both. Many rules are possible, but the following are the most basic and commonly used.
