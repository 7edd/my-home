## Info 
- Skinner discovered that how and when a behaviour is reinforced could influence how resistant it was to extinction. He found that a partial schedule of reinforcement (reinforcing a behaviour only part of the time) helped reduce the chances of extinction. Rather than reinforcing the behaviour each and every time it occurs, the reinforcement is given only after a certain amount of time has elapsed or a certain number of responses have occurred. 
- Schedules of reinforcement are rules that control the delivery of reinforcement.  The rules specify either the time that reinforcement is to be made available, or the number of responses to be made, or both. Many rules are possible, but the following are the most basic and commonly used.

- **Continuous reinforcement:** Reinforcement occurs after each response. Organisms typically respond as rapidly as they can, given the time taken to obtain and consume reinforcement, until they are satiated.
- **Fixed ratio schedule:** Reinforcement occurs after a fixed number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. An organism trained on this schedule typically pauses for a while after a reinforcement and then responds at a high rate. If the response requirement is low there may be no pause; if the response requirement is high the organism may quit responding altogether.
- **Variable ratio schedule:** Reinforcement occurs after a variable number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a very high, persistent rate of response.
- **Fixed interval schedule:** Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a fixed time has elapsed after the previous reinforcement. This schedule yields a "break-run" pattern of response; that is, after training on this schedule, the organism typically pauses after reinforcement, and then begins to respond rapidly as the time for the next reinforcement approaches.
- **Variable interval schedule:** Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a variable time has elapsed from the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a relatively steady rate of response that varies with the average time between reinforcements.
