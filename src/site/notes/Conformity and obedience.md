# Conformity - Asch

## Aim

to determine if individuals would conform to group pressure 

## Method

- 87 male college students 
- Materials: series of cards each showing a standard line and 3 comparison lines
- Participant was asked to judge the length of lines in a room with several other confederates (actors) who agreed to give incorrect answers. There were 18 trials in total and in 12 critical trials confederates gave wrong answer.

## Key Findings

- Over the 12 critical trials about 75% of participants conformed at least once, and 25% of participant never conformed. In the control group, with no pressure to conform to confederates, less than 1% of participants gave the wrong answer.

## Contribution to Psychology

- provided insight into the conditions in which people conform and the reasons why people conform

## Criticisms and Limitations of the Study

- Asch used a biased sample as all participants were male college students in the same age group

# Obedience Milgram (1963)

## Aim

- To determine if individuals would obey an authority figure if it harmed another person

## Method

- Participants: 40 males aged 20 to 50 years
- Materials: simulated shock generator and a list of word-pairs

- Participants were the role of “experimenter” (an actor),“teacher” (a paid volunteer) while another participant was assigned the role of “learner” (an actor).

- The experimenter (dressed in a lab coat) asked the teachers to administer electric shocks with increasing voltage for each incorrect answer given and urged the teacher to continue when they began resisting the shocks. There were 30 switches on the shock generator marked from 15 volts (slight shock) to 450 (danger – severe shock).
- Prod 1: Please continue.  
    Prod 2: The experiment requires you to continue.  
    Prod 3: It is absolutely essential that you continue.  
    Prod 4: You have no other choice but to continue.

## Results

- 65% of participants continued to shock the learner to the highest voltage of 450v. 100% of participants reached 300v.

## Conclusion

Ordinary people are likely to follow orders given by an authority figure, even to the extent of killing an innocent human being.
