# Nina Simone (1933-2003) To Be Young, Gifted and Black (1969)

## Key info 
#### Context 
- Born in North Carolina 
- Played Piano in church, - Gospel relation 
- Born into a state with continued racial violence 
- Attended Juilliard school of music 

### Song
- **After the furious song ‘Mississippi Goddam’ and other songs of struggle and discrimination, ‘To Be Young, Gifted and Black’, focuses on the hope of youth, and the imperative to not define blackness as inherent struggle: ‘There’s a world waiting for you/ This is a quest that’s just begun’.**

-  The song in question was a collaboration between Nina Simone and Weldon J. Irvine Jr., with Irvine writing the lyrics. Unlike some of Simone's other songs that addressed civil rights and oppression, this piece is more about hope and the potential for a better future, though it does touch on haunting themes in its final verse. 

- It's not a lament or a direct call to action but rather celebrates black culture and identity, emphasising solidarity and positivity.

- "Young, Gifted and Black" conveys hope through the perspective of youth, a common theme in Civil Rights movements.

- The theme of youth as hope is present in various contexts, including contemporary movements like the Uluru Statement from the Heart.  ** <font size=1> The Uluru Statement from the Heart is a 2017 petition to the people of Australia, written and endorsed by the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders selected as delegates to the First Nations National Constitutional Convention. </font>
- 
- "To Be Young, Gifted and Black" is unique in its targeted audience, addressing exclusively African Americans rather than society at large or white Americans.

- The use of "you" in the song's second verse, "There’s a world waiting for you," differs significantly from the use of "you" in Nina Simone's "Mississippi Goddam," where it refers to a broader societal or white American audience.

- This distinction highlights the song's focus on empowering and uplifting the African American community specifically, rather than appealing to a broader audience or addressing systemic issues with society as a whole.
## Comparative works 
- Billie Holiday - Strange Fruit 
- James Brown – ‘Say it Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud’ (1968)
- Any other Nina Simone song, Missisipi Goddamn, Strange fruit ect. 

## Analysis
#### Form 
- **Strophic Form** - AAA
- Comparing the melodic contour of the final verse to the first two verses. Simone sings a fairly different melody, which mimics somewhat the improvisation style of early jazz and vocalists from the earlier parts of the twentieth century.
	- **Jazz influence, African American identity **
## Instrumentation 
- Simone performs on piano and is accompanied by a range of male and female singers. 

- There is an ensemble who acts as backing for Simone, featuring saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and rhythm section. 
	- **Jazz, gospel instrumentation, African American identity**
- There is a prominent vibraphone present in the studio recording. This instrument had been popularised in jazz through its use in the Modern Jazz Quartet.

## Harmony 
- Simple, less adventurous harmony 
- However, referring to the version of the score selected by SCSA for study, there are a number of chords listed with extensions. These chords (e.g. Eaug7 b. 10 and G11 b. 31) highlight the jazz harmonic sensibilities of Simone  
	- **Jazz influence, African American identity, Nina Simones context.**

# Amy Beach (1867-1944) Gaelic Symphony (1894) first movement
## Key info 
- The first American woman to find success as a composer of large-scale art music. She was also the first American trained concert pianist, and amongst the first generation of American professional female instrumentalists.

#### Challenges and Issues Faced by Amy Beach in Her Life:

- **Gender Bias in Music Composition:**
-  Beach faced challenges due to the prevailing belief that large-scale compositions like symphonies were primarily a male domain. Critics like George Whitefield Chadwick praised her work but also highlighted the anomaly of a successful female composer in that era.
- Composer Ruth Crawford Seeger also faced similar biases, indicative of a broader trend where women composers were often compared to men or praised for writing "like a man."

- **Marital Constraints and Professional Career:**
- After her marriage, Beach's husband discouraged her from public performances as a pianist but supported her compositional ambitions. This reflects the societal expectations placed on married women during that time.
- Beach adopted her husband's name professionally, signing her compositions as "Mrs. H. H. A. Beach," which was considered proper for married Bostonians, reflecting the norms of the era regarding women's identities.

- **Limited Formal Training and Autodidactic Learning:**
- Unlike many aspiring musicians of her time who went to Europe for formal training, Beach's formal compositional education was limited to just one year. Her gender and marital status restricted her access to opportunities for further training.
- Despite these limitations, Beach embarked on a rigorous self-taught program over a decade, showcasing her determination and resilience in overcoming educational barriers.

- **Professional Recognition and Legacy:**
- Despite facing societal and institutional barriers, Beach achieved significant success as a composer, with over three hundred works produced and widespread performance and publication of her compositions during her lifetime.
- Her legacy includes being part of the Second New England School, a group of American composers who made a collective impact on the music scene, challenging the dominance of European traditions.
- Beach's significance extends beyond her compositions; she also contributed to music education and advocacy for fellow musicians, co-founding organizations and holding leadership positions to support music education and women composers.

## Comparative works 
## Female composers 
- Clara Schumann 
	- Clara faced many challenges, including **her father's opposition to her career, her husband's illness and death, the loss of four children, and the sexism of her time**.
- Florence Price 
	- first major female African American composer.
	- Two major disadvantages, racism, sexism 
- Fanny Mendelssohn 
	- Female composer, published works (8) under her brothers name (Felix)

Any works by the above such as Clara Schumann piano concerto 

-  Antonín Dvořák (1841–1904), Symphony No. 9 in E Minor, “From the New World” (1893)
	- Dvořák was a well-established composer by the time he went to take up a lucrative position leading a new music conservatory in New York in 1892. His three-year stint as director would include the composition of his most famous work, his ninth symphony. Unlike many musical nicknames which often have very little to do with the composers, Dvořák himself named this symphony “From the New World.” The influences of his new home include Longfellow’s

- Amy Beach, Piano Concerto in C-Sharp Minor, Op. 45 (1899) 
	- Beach’s only piano concerto came at a time when she was trying to find a way back to the concert stage. In that regard, it was a success with the composer playing the premiere in 1900 and then subsequently performing it with nine more different major orchestras in the United States and Europe before 1917. It is large-scale, four-movement, late-Romantic work—entirely appropriate for a virtuoso of Beach’s standing and ability. Beach has called it a “veritable autobiography,” and the work includes quotations from earlier songs. The second movement, for example, quotes “Empress of the Night” and “Twilight”—both settings of her husband’s poetry.
