# Sensation and perception precesses 
Order 
- Stimulus energy 
	- Light, sound, smell
- Sensory receptors 
	- Eyes, ears, nose
- Neural implulses 
- Brain 
	- Visual, auditory, Olfactory areas.

## Sensation
The physiological process involving sensory receptors detecting. Responding to stimuli 

Precess that allows our brains to take in information via our five senses, which can then be experienced and interpreted by the brain 

There are three distinct processes involved in sensation; reception transduction and transmission 

### 3 processes involved in sensation 

#### Reception 
- The stimulation of sensory receptor cells 
- The presence of physical stimuli (such as sound waves and light) is detected by our sensory neurons in our sense organs 
	Eg: a ball hits a persons arm and is detected by the sensory neurons in the skin 

#### Transduction
- Converting the energy of the stimulus into electro=chemical energy (neural signals)
	Eg: the kinetic energy from the ball is converted to electro chemical signal 

#### Transmission 
- The delivering of this neural information to the brain for processing 
	Eg: delivered to the parietal lobe for processing 

## Perception
The mental process of organising and interpreting sensory stimuli so tat it is meaningful 

There are three distinct processes in involved in perception - selection, organisation and interpretation

- Because past experiences and motivation can affect how our brain organises and selects information we may perceive something different from another person, even though they are exposed to the same stimuli
- Past experience also leads you to build up expectations about how you will perceive and to respond to certain stimuli. This is call perceptual expectancy. 

## Perceptual expectancy 
- A readiness to respond in a certain way because pervious experience has prepared you which leads you to see what you expect to see. 

### 3 processes involved in sensation 
#### Selection 
- The brain filters the stimuli selecting important features for further processing while ignoring unimportant feature that receive no further processing 
- There are special neurons called feature detectors involved in this process 
- Since we cant tune in to each and every one of the thousands of messages and images were exposed to 
- daily, we tend to only pay attention to information that we perceive to meet our needs or interests 

#### Organisation 
- The stimuli that an individual chooses to attend to is arranged into patters that are meaningful and easy to understand

#### Interpretation 
-  we assign meaning to our experiences using mental structures. 
- Interpretation of sensory information is determined by personal values, experiences, beliefs, needs, involvement and other personal factors. 
- These factors make the interpretations stage subjective
