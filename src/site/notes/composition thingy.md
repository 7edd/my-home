I began working on my musical piece, drawing inspiration from a diverse range of compositions. Two tracks that particularly caught my attention were "Princess Leia's Theme" by John Williams and "Grandma & Destruction" from the game NieR. These pieces resonated with me, and I sought to incorporate elements from them into my own creation.

To start off, I focused on developing the chord progression and crafting a basic melody. I aimed to infuse the melody with rich harmonies, emphasising the use of extended chords such as 9ths and other larger chord extensions. This process took me a couple of weeks as I carefully honed the dynamics and phrasing, ensuring that the piano sketch captured the intended emotions and atmosphere.

Once I felt satisfied with the initial composition, I decided to explore the possibilities of orchestration to enhance the impact of key moments within the piece. I wanted to highlight specific sections by employing different instrumentations and textures, adding depth and variety to the overall arrangement.

The piece begins with a robust orchestral introduction, where multiple sections of the orchestra collectively outline the underlying harmony. This establishes the musical foundation that the rest of the piece will follow. a violin solo takes centre stage, accompanied by the harp to keep the harmony. The orchestra then builds up, leading to a climactic moment, only to subvert expectations by transitioning seamlessly back into the main melody, but this time with a powerful forte section. This contrast creates a sense of tension and excitement, capturing the listener's attention.

In the final section, I focused on further developing the harmonies and intricacies of the orchestration. This allowed me to create a more complex and layered musical texture, culminating in a grand and impactful moment of clarity. This section serves as the culmination of the piece, leading towards a satisfying resolution that brings the musical journey to a fulfilling conclusion.

## Boreas

My composition draws inspiration from Debussy, Hisaishi, and Sakamoto. Building upon half diminished chords, the piece establishes tension and uneasiness. I followed this by working towards resolving the tension smoothly, as if youâ€™re falling into the resolution. To maintain seamless flow and momentum, a dominant chord acts as a pivot point between harmonic contexts. It adds underlying tension, and pushes the piece forward. Quartal and quintal harmonies contribute an ethereal and spacious quality, creating an ambient and atmospheric sound. 

The gradual development of these harmonies adds depth and expansiveness to the composition. Briefly departing from traditional tonality, the whole tone scale introduces an otherworldly and dreamlike quality, providing contrast and intrigue. Deliberately incorporating moments of clarity and confusion, multiple key changes create tonal confusion while retaining tonality.

This fosters anticipation, curiosity, and emotional engagement, leading to moments of heightened understanding and emotion. A significant tonal shift around the end, transitions keys upward, evoking brightness and hope. This serves as a cathartic release following moments of tension and confusion. Finally, the composition concludes with an ambiguous chord, offering a sense of completion while leaving room for interpretation and contemplation. The melodies used throughout the piece were greatly inspired by Joe Hisaishi, while being memorable and repetitive, it also invokes a sense of nostalgia.
