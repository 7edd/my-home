To understand the significance of this image, we must first understand its context. The photograph was taken on the 5th of June, 1989, during the Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing, China. The protests were a student led movement demanding democracy and political reform in the country. The protests lasted for several weeks and were met with violent suppression by the Chinese government. On June 4, the Chinese military was ordered to clear the square by force, resulting in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of protestors. The protests started because students wanted more democracy and changes in their country. They lasted for many weeks and showed that the people were dissatisfied with the way things were. The protesters wanted more freedom, honesty, and fairness from the government. Many people in China and around the world paid attention to these protests because they represented a strong desire for better rights and showed that regular people could make a difference. _NEXT SLIDE_
