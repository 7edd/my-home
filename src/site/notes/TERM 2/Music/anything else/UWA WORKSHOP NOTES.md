# **Imitation**

Bach: invention No.8 in F

Repeated imitation between bars, 1 for 1. Accompaniment 

Maintains contour even though the variation is broken up.

- work with the materials that you have, reuse ideas already made up
- With imitation, you are working with something you already have 

  

Techniques for imitation 

- augmentation/diminution (slowing down and speeding up)
- Inversion 
- Retrograde 

  

## **Augmentation**

  

### **Sibelius Symphony No. 5**

- uses the melody as a baseline, just augments it down 0.3 speed
- 3rd below the melody to make it more interesting 

### **Arvo Part Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten**

- repeats but goes down one more not every time 
- violin 2 is augmented at half the speed, down the octave 
- each other string instrument added is slower and slower 
- double bass ends up being 16x slower.
- not heard as a canon even though being one 
- Fratras arvo part :listen  French word for brothers 

  

## **Inversion**

2 types of inversion  
tonal and exact (atonal) 

### **Bela Bartok: Mikrokosmos No. 79**

- inverted left hand, displaced rhythmically 

  
## **Retrograde**

### **Bach Musical Offering 1747**

- piece can be played backwards 

Points to remember  
look at your material  
What can you do to continue utilising it  
Try inverting it  
try retrograding it
