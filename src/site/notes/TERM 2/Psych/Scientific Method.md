Everything on there :/ !! 

## Scientific Method

### 1. Identify Research Issue and Form a Research Aim
- An aim **identifies the purpose of the investigation**. It is a straightforward expression of what the researcher is trying to find out from conducting an investigation.

### 2. Develop Exact Question or Hypothesis

**Non-directional hypothesis** - simply states that there will be a difference between the two groups/conditions but does not say which will be greater/smaller, quicker/slower etc. 

e.g. There will be a difference between the number of cold symptoms experienced in the following week after exposure to a virus for those participants who have been sleep deprived for 24 hours compared with those who have not been sleep deprived for 24 hours.

**Directional hypothesis** - states which way you think the results are going to go (prediction), for example in an experimental study we might say:

*e.g. Participants who have been deprived of sleep for 24 hours will have more cold symptoms in the following week after exposure to a virus than participants who have not been sleep deprived

**Directional hypothesis** - states which way you think the results are going to go (prediction), for example in an experimental study we might say:

*e.g. Participants who have been deprived of sleep for 24 hours will have more cold symptoms in the following week after exposure to a virus than participants who have not been sleep deprived

### 3. Choose Research Design and Method

#### [[TERM 2/Psych/Experimental Method\|Experimental Method]]
- involves a formal trial to confirm or refute a prediction. (control and experimental group)
- The most powerful research tool is an experiment!

#### [[TERM 2/Psych/Non Experimental Method\|Non Experimental Method]]
- Observational 
- Case study
- Correlational 
- Longitudinal
- Cross-sectional
### 4. Collect Data
**Qualitative data** – descriptive information in the form of words.  
**Quantitative data** – information in the form of numbers that can be counted.
### 5. Analyse Data
[[Analyse Data\|Analyse Data]]
### 6. Interpret Data

### 7. Report Findings
