# Stylistic Devices Employed in "the fly"

## Symbolism

- The fly: the trapped fly in the ink pot serves as a symbol of the fragility, vulnerability, and the fleeting nature of life. It represents the boss's preoccupation with death and loss
- The ink pot: the ink pot symbolises the boss's grief and his attempts to escape from it by focusing on the struggles of the fly.

## Irony

- The boss's obsession: it is ironic that the boss. Who has experienced personal tragedy and loss during the war, becomes fixated on the insignificant. Struggles of a flu, highlighting the human tendency to fiver attention from their own pain.
- The boss realisation: the final revelation that the boss had been prepared to kill the fly all along, despite his earlier empathy towards it, adds an ironic twist to the story. It suggests that even in the face of loss, one's capacity of empathy can diminish over time 

## Foreshadowing

- The boss's memories: throughout the story, the boss's recollections of his son; s death and the sight of his photograph foreshadow the underlying grief and loss that will be revealed at the end. 
- The darkened room : the repeated description of the boss; s office as dimly lit and shrouded in shadows creates a sombre atmosphere, foreshadowing the heavy emotions that will be explored

## Imagery

- The vivid descriptions of the boss's office reflects his status and wealth and diverts attention from the pain of the lingering grief and loss he feels for his deceased son 

## Repetition 
- The repetition of the towards "ink pot" and "fly" emphasises their significance as symbols and reinforces the boss's preoccupation with the fly and his attempt to find solace
- The repetition of the word "boy" throughout the story serves as a reminder of the boss's loss and contributes to the overall melancholic tone - many of the soldiers killed in WW1 were very young
- The repetition of the word "little" to describe the flu underscores the insignificance of the fly's struggles and contrasts it with the boss's fixation on it.
- Repetition is also employed mostly to show the way the boss thinks and speaks: "no, no!" for various reasons the boss had not been across" "New carpet," and he pointed to the bright red carpet, with a pattern of large white rings. "New furniture," and he nodded toward the massive book-case"
