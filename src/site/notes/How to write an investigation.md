# What is Scientific Writing

The purpose of scientific writing is to communicate new scientific findings in a scientific paper, which is published whereby peers of the author can repeat the experiment and test conditions 

It has to be clear, simple and well-ordered communication to transmit new scientific findings. 

# Some Important Language Points

- Avoid complex sentence structure
- Use simple and clear English
- Always keep in mind that the paragraph is the essential unit of thought 

## General Rules

- Cite peer-reviewed scientific literature or scholarly reviews. 
- Avoid general reference works such as textbooks or Wikipedia 
- Define any specialised words. Terms, acronyms, or abbreviations 

# Introduction

The introduction should answer the following in 500 – 750 words. Each thing is 1 paragraph. 

1. Start with some general / background information (define keywords etc). 
2. Identify and communicate the theory behind the investigation 
3. identify and communicate 2 past research behind the investigation (name, aim, methods, results, conclusions) and how it relates to your investigation 
	- (Past research needs to include name, aim, methods, results, conclusion, and link.)
4. At the end of your introduction, you need to include 
- Aim 
- Hypothesis 
- Independent variable
- Dependant variable 

# Methods Section

Provide full details so that the experiment is reproducible by someone else 

Organise the methods under subheadings: 
- Participants 
- Materials
- Procedures  
Number each step of the method  
Describe the experiment design in detail  
Do not mix some of the results in this section  
Write past tense, do not use pronouns 

# Results

The results section should have nothing but the results  
Only tables and graphs should be used in this section  
Each table and graph needs to be labelled as “table 1” “graph 1” 

# Discussion

It is the hardest section to write in approx. 500 – 700 words  
Its primary purpose is to show the relationship among observed facts  
It should end with a short summary or conclusion regarding the significance of the work to the wider community 

## Paragraph One:

This paragraph is used to analyse the results section, when discussing the results. You must refer to the table or graph you are discussing. 

- Identifies whether the hypothesis was supported or rejected by the findings and explains why, is there a relationship between the two variables, what is its direction and strength likely to be  

This paragraph should only be around 4 – 5 sentences long. 

## Paragraph Two

This is the hardest paragraph to write.

This paragraph analyses your results and links to research paragraph one. Links the data to the findings from past research or theories from introduction and explains how these ideas support this research. 

## Paragraph Three

This paragraph is used to discuss the problems or mistakes that you made while performing the experiment 
- Describes at least two uncontrolled variables that might have affected the results
- What you would do to fix the errors in the experiment and directions for future research 

## Paragraph Four

This paragraph used to describe relevant ethical issues (e.g. informed consent) and addresses improvements to ethical issues incurred. 

## Paragraph five 

This paragraph is used to tell the reader what the broader significance of your investigation is. 

- Explains if this study can be generalised to others 
- E.g. the general population – why or why not 

# Conclusion 
Restate your hypothesis 
State whether you supported your hypothesis or not.
