# Learning 
- The **acquisition of knowledge** that is **relatively permanent change**, **often** **of behaviour**, that **occurs** as a **result of experience **

Early theories described learning as a result of responding to a stimulus in the environment, known as the **Stimulus-Response** approach
	Environmental stimulus -> Behavioural response

# Stimulus Response Models
## Classical conditioning 
Associate an **involuntary** response to a **stimulus**
- Learning caused by pairing, or associating, of two stimuli. 
- An **association** forms between **two stimuli, one** of which is **not normally associated** with the **desired response,** so that the **appearance of that stimulus** results in the **desired behaviour**

	- **A neutral stimulus triggers a conditioned response.** 

- We learn to associate a stimulus with a response, and eventually our body does this automatically in the presence of the stimulus. **Our response in involuntary.**
Explains some learning of involuntary emotional and physiological responses

### Ivan Pavlov (1902)
A leading theorist in Classical Conditioning was Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist (NOT a psychologist)

#### Stimulus generalisation 
- Demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus 
- This was very evident in Watson and Rayners study with little Albert 
#### Stimulus discrimination 
- Learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar 

### Extinction 
- Decrease in the conditioned response when the unconditiond stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus 
### Spontaneous recovery
- The return of a previously extinguished conditioned response following a rest period 

## Operant conditioning 
Associate a **voluntary** behaviour and a **consequence**
