# Factors Effecting conformity

## Normative Social Influence

- The pressure of an individual to change their behaviour to conform to group standards in order to be accepted by the group 
- In this type of social influence, individuals do not necessarily share the same belief as the majority, but choose to disregard this fact in order to fit in 

## Informational Social Influence

- The pressure on individuals when in strange situations to behave in the manner of those around them 
- Individuals seek the knowledge held by hose in the group when deciding how best to behave 
	- We often conform when we are in strange situation 
	- Person conforms because they have the desire to be right 

## Group Size

The bigger the group the more people conform, up to a certain point. After group size reached a certain limit of five, conformity didn't increase any further after that.

## Group Unanimity

When others in the group are unanimous (agree completely) it is difficult to stand out. Ash found that if only one participant disagreed with the others, the amount of conformity was greatly reduced.

## Culture

### Individualistic Cultures

- The value people standing out as an individual, and individual needs over the group, and believe independence and self reliance are important 

### Collectivist Cultures

- Value the needs of the group over the individual interests and view individuals putting themselves first as selfish behaviour 

#### Highest Levels of conformity = Collectivist Cultures
#### Lowest Levels of conformity = Individualist Cultures

## Deindinviduation 
- State when you become so immersed in the norms of the group that you lose your sense of identity and personal responsibility 
	- Self awareness shifts away rom the self to the group situations and a mentality of 'everyone else is doing it so i can do it too' occurs 
	- Excitement of the situation leads to individuals to feel anonymous and less self conscious 
	- Consequences of the behaviour are not considered and people in the group feel less responsibility for their own behaviour as it is shared among the group
