# Overview
- Henry is a famous case of anterograde and retrograde amnesia in psychology 
- H.M underwent brain surgery to remove his hippocampus and amygdala to control his seizures. As a result of his surgery, HM's seizures decreased, but he could no longer form new memories or remember the prior 11 years of his life.
- He lost his ability to form many types of new memories, such as new facts or faces.
- The surgery also caused retrograde amnesia as he was able to recall childhood events but lost the ability to recall experiences a few Years before his surgery
- The case of HM and his life long participation in studies gave researchers valuable insight into how memory functions and is organised

# Background
- Suffered from epileptic seizures believed to be caused by a bicycle accident he had when he was 9.
- They continued to worsen in severity throughout young adulthood to the point HM was eventually too disabled to work. 
- Using an EEG doctors measured his brain activity but were unable to pinpoint the specific location the seizures originated. However, they believed they were originating in the medial regions of his left and right temporal loves. 
- Age 27, agreed to undergo a radical surgery that would involve removing a part of his brain called the hippocampus - the region believed to be source of his epileptic seizures. 
- At the time of his surgery the scientific / medical community was not fully aware of the true function of the hippocampus and its specific role in memory. 

# Procedure 
- Surgery performed in 1953
- Scoville performed a **partial medial temporal lobe resection** removing the medial portions of the temporal loves - extending 9 cm towards the back of the brain in each lobe. 
- This removed the pair of amygdala and the majority of both hippocampi 

# Post surgery amnesia
- Demonstrated both retrograde and anterograde amnesia.
- Retrograde amnesia: the inability to recall past memories prior to the onset of amnesia. Anterograde amnesia: the inability to for new memories after developing amnesia. 
- Suffered from retrograde amnesia for the 11 year period prior to his surgery buy his childhood memories were largely unaffected.
- Demonstrated inability to form new declarative memories- the result of the loss of the hippocampus. 
- Demonstrated difficulty with the transferral of information from short term to long term stores. However. When repeatedly given two tests to asses long term memory: incomplete pictures test and mirror-drawing, he showed improvement over time. Though he had no recollection of sitting the tests daily, his performance improved over time. Demonstrating that he was unconsciously creating procedural memories. This led to the understanding that long term memory is made up of both declarative and procedural memories.

# Conclusions and contributions 
- Until the surgery, it was not known that the hippocampus was essential for making memories. 
- His case indicated procedural memories are not controlled by hippocampus and amygdala, but in other brain regions 
- His inability to form declarative memories in the absence of his hippocampus led to the conclusion that the hippocampus is vital in the production of declarative memories. Information in his short term memory being unable to be encoded into long term memory.

# Cerebellum - location and overview 
- Structure located underneath the cerebrum 
- Involved in balance, coordination of fine motor skills and judging distance. 
- Involved in the formation and storage of procedural memories 

## Functions 

### Memory formations 
- Involved in the formation of procedural memories. 
- These are unconscious or implicit memories such as motor memories such as how to draw a certain shape. 
### Storage of memories 
- Involved in the storage of procedural memories, specifically leaned sensorimotor skills. Eg cutting paper

# Amygdala 
- Collection of nuclei deep within each temporal lobe.
- Part of brains limbic system. Which plays a key role in how animals assess and respond to environmental threats and challenges by evaluating the emotional importance of sensory information and prompting an appropriate response.
- **Primarily involved in the processing of emotions and memories associated with fear.** 
- Has connections to many other brain structures = can link to areas in order to process ‘higher’ cognitive information with systems that control ‘lower’ functions (such as autonomic responses like breathing, touch, and sensitivity).
- This allows the amygdala to organise physiological responses based on the cognitive information available. The most well-known example of this is the fight-or-flight response.
